(* This file has the purpose of dealing with side effects of the abstract tactic. This is all very
   uninteresting, but has to be dealt with because the constants 'abstract' generates disappear, which
   result in lookup errors.

   Several options to fix this:
   1. Inline constants into terms using Safe_typing.inline_private_constants. This kind of works, but results
   in large terms because the constants are always inlined, even if they are not referenced. Not what we want.
   Additionally, we have no way of inlining in tactics.

   2. Just replace private constants with a placeholder. We choose this for its simplicity.
